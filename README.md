# Course Scheduler

This is a project I completed while apart of three separate teams working in three separate repos. For viewing convenience I have ported it over to this github and combined them all into one repository, with the entire commit history included. Unfortunately, PR's, issues, and our wiki pages cannot be automatically ported, so you'll have to use your imagination for that part.

This project is a course scheduling application, where my teams were responsible for writing almost the entirety of the backend Java code. To put it into more design based terms, we were responsible for the Model and the Controllers but not the View. The view was done using Java's Swing library and communicated with our code directly, rather than through an API (That comes later in my projects).

In terms of scope, this application will allow administrators to add classrooms, student and teacher accounts, timeslots, events, etc. Teachers can add students, accept classes, manage their timeslots and events. Students can add classes to their schedule, enroll in courses, view information about all the classes in a GUI, and make decisions based on that.

In short, it works just like how you would apply for college courses, in fact much of the data we used is directly from our school's courses and is publicly available.

# Development

This was developed in Eclipse in teams of 2-3. I focused heavily on implementation and test rather than design. 

To run this project, I would suggest importing it into eclipse and running it from there using eclipse's runner.
